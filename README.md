1. To execute this code, clone the repository using git clone `git clone https://github.com/davidbombal/python-keylogger.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory with the command `cd python-keylogger`
3. Create a virtual environment on Windows using the command `<python_path>\py -m venv keylogger_env`
4. Activate the virtual environment with the command `keylogger_env\Scripts\activate`
5. Install all the required packages within your virtual environment by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
6. Run the program using `py keylogger.py`.
